summary: Deploys KubeVirt into a Charmed-Kubernetes cluster
description: |-
  This charm allows for installation of a selectable version of
  kubevirt into a cluster. KubeVirt allows for virtual machine
  instances to be launched as kubernetes workloads which
  interact with other internal services within a kubernetes cluster.

    image-registry:

      description: |
        Source registry of metrics server images.

        By setting to a value, each image listed in the releases manifest
        has its image-registry replaced.

        If unset, the manifests will use the image registry from the kube-control relation

        example)
          juju config kube-virt image-registry='quay.io'

          juju config kube-virt --reset image-registry

    software-emulation:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Whether to allow software-emulation of VMs
        true: allows such behavior
        false: disallows such behavior
        unset: automatically determined by the group of units

        example)
          juju config kube-virt software-emulation=true

          juju config kube-virt software-emulation=false

          juju config kube-virt --reset software-emulation

    pvc-tolerate-less-space-up-to-percent:
      type: int
      description: |
        Filesystem PVCs:
          Since not every storage provisioner provides volumes
          with the exact usable amount of space as requested
          (e.g. due to filesystem overhead), KubeVirt tolerates
          up to 10% less available space.

      default: 10

    operator-release:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specify the version of kubevirt as defined by the release
        tags of https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/releases/tags

        example)
          juju config kube-virt operator-release='v0.58.0'

        A list of supported versions is available through the action:
          juju run-action kube-virt/leader list-releases --wait

        To reset by to the latest supported by the charm use:
          juju config kube-virt --reset operator-release

        The current release deployed is available by viewing
          juju status kube-virt
